Simple repo to hold dotfiles that I keep having to recreate whenever I
get a new machine.

All the files (- this readme) (- the script i'm about to tell you about) 
should be copied to ~/ To do this just run copyAllTheThings.sh. chmod it 
if you have to.

You're going to want to back your stuff up first though, currently, I don't do that for you. Feature request.
